### Zest Protocol â€“ Landing Page

[Main Site](https://www.zestprotocol.com/)

**Overview**

Zest Protocol is a decentralized lending protocol built on Bitcoin via the Stacks blockchain. It enables institutions and individuals to participate in on-chain lending, helping unlock the capital potential of Bitcoin in a secure and transparent way.

**My Role**

I designed and implemented Zest's first marketing landing page to capture early interest and collect user emails. I led the UI design in Figma, creating a clean, high-conversion layout with compelling messaging and strong brand alignment. I also developed the front end and integrated a lightweight email capture solution using Google Sheets.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (UI design & iteration)
- HTML/CSS/React
- Google Sheets (form integration)
- GitHub (version control)

**Highlights**

- Designed and shipped a production-ready landing page focused on user acquisition.
- Balanced clear messaging with strong visual hierarchy and branding.
- Set up a simple, scalable system to collect and manage user leads.
- Supported early growth and marketing efforts through design and implementation.
