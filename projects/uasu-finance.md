# Website Redesign

As part of a broader effort to strengthen UASU Finance's brand and product clarity, I led a comprehensive redesign of the marketing site, focused on improving user comprehension, visual appeal, and credibility in a highly technical and trust-sensitive domain.

## Before:

The original version relied on generic illustrations and a conventional fintech color palette, which, while serviceable, lacked the visual depth and uniqueness necessary for a crypto-native product. The UI elements were sparse, and the overall layout followed a standard template with minimal hierarchy, resulting in reduced information absorption and user engagement.

## After:

The redesigned version introduces a bold, high-contrast visual system inspired by trading dashboards and dark-mode interfaces familiar to crypto users. I replaced illustrations with data-driven visuals and real chart patterns to signal seriousness, precision, and trustworthiness. Interactive modules — like the stabilization form — now feel more tactile and grounded, with subtle neon accents and grid patterns adding to the futuristic tone.

Key improvements include:

- A dramatically stronger first impression, thanks to the use of real trading data and immersive visual treatment.
- A much clearer information hierarchy and storytelling flow, guiding the user from value proposition to feature breakdown with purpose.
- A refined visual language rooted in crypto culture — dark theme, glowing accents, precision typography — that enhances brand credibility.
- Better CTA visibility and conversion cues, encouraging beta signups without overwhelming the user.

This redesign elevates UASU from a promising concept to a polished, investor- and user-facing platform — ready for early adoption.
