### Stacks Mfers

[View Collection on Gamma](https://stacks.gamma.io/collections/stacks-mfers)

**Overview**

Stacks Mfers is a playful NFT collection on the Stacks blockchain, inspired by the irreverent spirit of the original "mfers" project. It gave people a fun and accessible way to mint their own NFT and connect with the small, creative team behind the project.

**My Role**

I designed and built the website to support the minting experience and introduce the team behind the collection. The goal was to keep it simple, fun, and true to the project's laid-back, meme-driven vibe. I handled the visual design in Figma and implemented the front-end code, making sure the minting flow was easy to use.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (playful visual design)
- HTML/CSS/React
- Integration with the Gamma marketplace and Stacks minting flow

**Highlights**

- Designed and shipped a fun, approachable site for a niche NFT audience.
- Delivered a smooth minting experience for users new to the Stacks ecosystem.
- Captured the energy of the project with bold visuals and informal tone.
- Handled the full scope from design to front-end development.
