### Arkadiko Protocol – Marketing Site Evolution

[Current Site](https://arkadiko.finance/)

**Overview**
Arkadiko is a DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, offering a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin (USDA) and suite of decentralized financial products. Over two years, I designed and built three distinct iterations of the marketing site, each responding to evolving brand strategy and product positioning.

## Version 3: Complete Brand Redesign (2023)

[View Live Site](https://arkadiko.finance/)

**The Challenge**
The previous marketing site relied on generic fintech styling that lacked the visual depth and uniqueness necessary for a crypto-native product. The goal was to elevate Arkadiko from a promising concept to a polished, investor- and user-facing platform ready for early adoption.

**My Role**
**Lead Designer & Front-end Developer**

I led a comprehensive redesign of the marketing site, focused on improving user comprehension, visual appeal, and credibility in a highly technical and trust-sensitive domain.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Replaced generic illustrations** with data-driven visuals and real chart patterns to signal seriousness, precision, and trustworthiness
- **Introduced bold, high-contrast visual system** inspired by trading dashboards and dark-mode interfaces familiar to crypto users
- **Created interactive modules** with subtle neon accents and grid patterns adding to the futuristic tone
- **Refined visual language** rooted in crypto culture—dark theme, glowing accents, precision typography—to enhance brand credibility

**Results:**

- Dramatically stronger first impression thanks to real trading data and immersive visual treatment
- Much clearer information hierarchy and storytelling flow, guiding users from value proposition to feature breakdown with purpose
- Better CTA visibility and conversion cues, encouraging beta signups without overwhelming users
- Elevated brand perception to match protocol's technical sophistication

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Figma

## Version 2: Simplified Product Focus (2023)

[Marketing Site v2](https://arkadiko.finance) (archived)

**The Challenge**
The initial site had become cluttered with content. The goal was to distill the protocol's offerings into clear, focused sections that improved clarity and navigation.

**My Role**
**Lead Designer & Front-end Developer**

I designed and built a simplified, three-section landing page that organized Arkadiko's products into three clear vertical blocks: **Keepers** (smart-contract automation), **USDA** (flagship stablecoin), and **DLCs** (native Bitcoin lending).

**Key Decisions:**

- Organized information architecture into three main vertical product-focused sections
- Relocated auxiliary content to dedicated subdomain (`usda.arkadiko.com`) for streamlined navigation
- Created lightweight, static site with hand-coded HTML/CSS for maximum performance
- Ensured fast load times, responsive design, and visual cohesion with Arkadiko's brand

**Results:**

- Clarified product hierarchy by spotlighting Keepers, USDA, and DLCs as standalone features
- Streamlined UX by simplifying navigation and improving page responsiveness
- Delivered clean, focused experience that aligned with Arkadiko's evolving brand strategy

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, Figma, minimal JavaScript

**The Challenge**
Launch the protocol's first marketing presence to capture early interest and collect user emails for the waitlist.

**My Role**
**UI Designer & Front-end Developer**

I designed and implemented Arkadiko's first marketing landing page, creating a clean, high-conversion layout with compelling messaging and strong brand alignment.

**Key Features:**

- Clean, conversion-focused layout designed in Figma
- Lightweight email capture integrated with Google Sheets
- Strong visual hierarchy and branding
- Fast, responsive implementation

**Results:**

- Supported early growth and marketing efforts through effective design
- Set up scalable system to collect and manage user leads
- Established initial visual identity that evolved through subsequent iterations

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, React, Google Sheets, Figma

## Evolution Summary

This three-phase journey demonstrates my ability to:

- **Iterate based on product evolution** – adapting design strategy as protocol matured
- **Balance simplicity and sophistication** – knowing when to strip down vs. build up
- **Establish and evolve brand identity** – from launch concept to polished crypto-native aesthetic
- **Execute end-to-end** – handling both design and front-end implementation across all versions
- **Respond to market positioning** – shifting from generic fintech to bold crypto culture

Each iteration solved specific problems: v1 captured early interest, v2 clarified product focus, v3 elevated brand credibility. Together, they show strategic design thinking beyond just making things look good.
