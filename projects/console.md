### Console – Landing Page

[Main Site](https://www.console.xyz/)

**Overview**

Console is a privacy-focused, on-chain communication platform designed for communities. Built for the decentralized future, Console provides secure messaging, governance tools, and integrations for Web3-native organizations.

**My Role**

I designed and implemented Console’s landing page to help introduce the product and collect emails from early users. I created the full-page layout in Figma, focusing on clarity, trust-building visuals, and conversion. I then handled the front-end implementation and integrated a simple email collection form using Google Sheets.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (UI design and iteration)
- HTML/CSS/React
- Google Sheets (email form integration)
- GitHub (collaboration and version control)

**Highlights**

- Designed and shipped a clean, responsive landing page aligned with Console's emerging brand.
- Created a straightforward lead collection system to support early growth.
- Balanced visual design with product messaging and technical feasibility.
- Enabled a fast turnaround from concept to launch by owning both design and static build.
