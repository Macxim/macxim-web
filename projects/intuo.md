### Intuo (U4TM) – Front-End & UX Development

**Overview**

Intuo (now U4TM) is a SaaS platform focused on employee engagement, team management, and performance tracking. The product combines structured workflows, dashboards, and onboarding experiences to help organizations manage teams at scale.

**My Role**

I worked as a Front-End / UX Developer, collaborating closely with the **engineering team** and **product design team**. My role sat at the intersection of implementation and user experience — translating complex product requirements and design specifications into reliable, maintainable front-end code while continuously improving usability.

A key part of my work was building and maintaining the company-wide design system, ensuring visual and interaction consistency across the product as it evolved.

**Tech & Tools**

- Ember.js (primary front-end framework)
- Ruby on Rails (backend collaboration)
- HTML & CSS (custom UI and layout work)
- Postgres & Redis (data layer awareness)
- Figma and design specs (design-to-code workflow)

**Highlights**

- Translated complex design specs into performant, maintainable front-end features used across the core product.
- Built and maintained a scalable design system, improving consistency and development speed across teams.
- Improved onboarding flows and dashboard usability, contributing to better customer retention.
- Worked long-term on a production SaaS product, balancing new features, refactors, and UX improvements.
