### Overview

Stacking DAO is a Bitcoin-native staking platform that simplifies STX delegation and reward tracking for users in the Stacks blockchain ecosystem. The application allows users to stake STX in a custodial or non-custodial manner and access transparent reward insights.

### My Role & Contributions

I was responsible for implementing the front-end of the application using React/Next.js, working from Figma designs and ensuring pixel-perfect translation to code. I collaborated closely with the design team and product managers to refine user flows and make complex staking processes intuitive. My work also involved close coordination with back-end engineers to ensure data integration, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience.

### Key Highlights

- Translated detailed Figma mockups into a fully functional React/Next.js interface.
- Enhanced UX by refining UI components and simplifying staking workflows.
- Worked cross-functionally with design, product, and back-end teams.
- Ensured mobile responsiveness and optimal performance.
