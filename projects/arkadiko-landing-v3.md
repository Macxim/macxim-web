[Marketing Site](https://arkadiko.finance/) • [USDA Stablecoin Site](https://usda.arkadiko.finance/)

### Overview

Arkadiko is a DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, offering a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin (USDA) and a suite of decentralized financial products. The v3 landing page was designed to clearly communicate Arkadiko’s value proposition, highlight its ecosystem, and convert visitors into active users.

### My Role & Contributions

I designed the v3 marketing website from scratch, delivering a modern, bold, and trust-building look. I focused on creating an engaging visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and interactive components that guide users through the protocol’s features and benefits. The design also emphasizes clarity in explaining complex DeFi concepts while maintaining brand consistency.

### Key Highlights

- Full redesign of the landing page with improved UX and branding consistency.
- Created interactive sections for features like USDA Stablecoin, DIKO governance token, and the product suite.
- Developed responsive layouts optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
- Integrated FAQ, audit information, and performance metrics for transparency and credibility.
- Designed with scalability in mind for future content updates.
