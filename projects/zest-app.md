### [Zest Protocol](https://www.zestprotocol.com/)

[App](https://app.zestprotocol.com/) • [Docs](https://docs.zestprotocol.com/start) • [GitHub](https://github.com/zest-Protocol/)

**Overview**

Zest Protocol is a decentralized lending protocol built on Bitcoin via the Stacks blockchain. It enables institutions and individuals to participate in on-chain lending, helping unlock the capital potential of Bitcoin in a secure and transparent way.

**My Role**

I joined the project from its inception, shaping the brand and product experience from the ground up. I designed the first-ever Zest logo and built out every screen of the application in Figma—iterating on each flow to meet evolving product needs.

I also designed and implemented Zest's marketing landing page focused on user acquisition, creating a clean, high-conversion layout with compelling messaging. I worked closely with the engineering team throughout, ensuring accurate design implementation and handling static front-end integration for both the app and marketing site.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (UI/UX design, branding, design system)
- React / Next.js (front-end development)
- HTML/CSS (landing page)
- GitHub (version control & collaboration)

**Highlights**

- Established the complete visual identity of the protocol through branding and logo design
- Designed the full application interface with multiple iterations based on user feedback
- Built production-ready marketing landing page with email capture for early growth
- Enabled smooth design-to-dev workflow by contributing directly to front-end implementation
- Played a key role in laying the design foundation for the protocol's long-term growth
