### [Zest Protocol](https://www.zestprotocol.com/)

[App](https://app.zestprotocol.com/) • [Docs](https://docs.zestprotocol.com/start) • [GitHub](https://github.com/zest-Protocol/)

**Overview**

Zest Protocol is a decentralized lending protocol built on Bitcoin via the Stacks blockchain. It enables institutions and individuals to participate in on-chain lending, helping unlock the capital potential of Bitcoin in a secure and transparent way.

**My Role**

I joined the project from its inception, shaping the brand and product experience from the ground up. I designed the first-ever Zest logo and built out every screen of the application in Figma—iterating on each flow to meet evolving product needs. I also worked closely with the engineering team to ensure accurate design implementation and handled the static front-end integration and UI translation.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (UI/UX design, design system creation)
- React / Next.js (static front-end integration)
- Close collaboration with full-stack engineers
- Version control via GitHub

**Highlights**

- Established the visual identity of the protocol through branding and logo design.
- Designed the complete user interface, with multiple iterations based on user and team feedback.
- Enabled a smooth design-to-dev workflow by contributing directly to static UI implementation.
- Played a key role in laying the design foundation for the protocol's long-term growth.
