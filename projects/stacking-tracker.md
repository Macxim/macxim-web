**Overview**

The Stacking Tracker is a web-based dashboard that provides real-time insights into Stacks (STX) staking activity. It offers a transparent view of stacking cycles, yield estimates, and protocol-wide performance metrics—making staking more accessible and data-driven for both new and experienced users.

**My Role**

I was responsible for translating the Figma designs into production-ready React/Next.js code. Collaborated closely with the design team and fellow front-end developers to build a responsive, pixel-perfect UI.

**Tech Stack**

- React / Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Figma (design handoff & iteration)
- GitHub (collaborative development)

**Highlights**

- Ensured faithful implementation of the design system while optimizing for performance and scalability.
- Streamlined collaboration between design and engineering for faster turnaround and consistent output.
- Helped launch a key resource in the Stacks ecosystem for tracking on-chain stacking behavior.
