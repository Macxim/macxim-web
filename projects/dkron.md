### Dkron – Documentation Site Redesign

[Main Site](https://dkron.io/)

**Overview**

Dkron is a distributed job scheduling system designed for cloud-native environments. It brings the power of cron jobs to a scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure — used by teams that need reliable, event-driven automation.

**My Role**

I led the visual redesign of Dkron’s documentation site to modernize its look and feel. The previous design was outdated and not engaging for the community. I created a cleaner, more readable layout in Figma, improving typography, spacing, and overall structure. My design was implemented using Tailwind CSS and integrated into the existing Docusaurus setup.

**Tech & Tools**

- Figma (UI redesign and layout improvements)
- Tailwind CSS (design system and styling)
- Docusaurus (existing framework)
- GitHub (collaboration and handoff)

**Highlights**

- Revamped the visual design of the docs to better reflect the maturity and professionalism of the Dkron project.
- Focused on readability, clarity, and user trust through thoughtful layout and hierarchy.
- Enhanced community perception by bringing a more polished and user-friendly experience to the documentation.
- Delivered design assets that were easy for the development team to implement with minimal friction.
