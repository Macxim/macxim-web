### Overview

The Arkadiko Analytics Dashboard is a live, data-driven portal offering comprehensive visibility into protocol health and user activity. It displays everything from financial metrics like TVL and token prices to real-time vault balances, pool statistics, and contract-specific breakdowns—making complex DeFi data easily digestible.

### My Role & Contributions

**Lead Designer & Front-end Developer**

- Designed a clean, intuitive layout in Figma and built the static, responsive interface.
- Structured data into thematic sections:
  - **TVL & Price Charts** – including a DeFiLlama TVL integration and DIKO/USDA price tracking.
  - **Balances Overview** – showing collateral and reserves across vaults, pools, and liquidity contracts.
  - **Protocol Actions** – insights into staking pools, swap activity, governance holdings, and yield claims.
- Integrated the **Balances** section, surfacing real-time data like STX and stSTX reserves, USDA liquidation pools, and contract-level breakdowns.
- Focused on performance and clarity: prioritized fast load times and legible formats for dense numerical data.

### Key Highlights

- Enabled real-time protocol visibility—from top-line metrics to granular balances.
- Presented vault reserves, pool stakes, and swap liquidity with clarity and visual hierarchy.
- Strengthened transparency by exposing otherwise buried smart contract data in a user-friendly format.
- Delivered a lightweight, responsive dashboard that's easy to navigate and visually consistent.
