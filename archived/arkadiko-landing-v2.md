[Marketing Site v2](https://arkadiko.finance)

### Overview

Arkadiko Landing v2 is a simplified, three-section landing page that distilled the protocol’s offerings into three clear vertical blocks: **Keepers** (smart-contract automation), **USDA** (Arkadiko’s flagship stablecoin product), and **DLCs** (native Bitcoin lending via Discrete Log Contracts). The previous content was migrated to a dedicated subdomain (`usda.arkadiko.com`), resulting in a lightweight, static, and highly responsive website.

### My Role & Contributions

**Lead Designer & Front-end Developer**

- Designed the full landing layout in Figma and developed the static site using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.
- Organized the information architecture into three main vertical product-focused sections to improve clarity and focus.
- Relocated auxiliary content out of the main site into a dedicated subdomain for streamlined navigation.
- Ensured the page remained fast, responsive, and visually cohesive with Arkadiko’s brand.

### Key Highlights

- Clarified the product hierarchy by spotlighting Keepers, USDA, and DLCs as standalone features.
- Streamlined UX by simplifying navigation and improving page load and responsiveness.
- Delivered a clean, focused experience that aligned with Arkadiko’s evolving brand strategy.
